# Coursera Developing Dataproducts Week 2 Assignment
The slides are hosted at https://nancyirisarri.github.io/coursera-developing-dataproducts-week2/#1. They are made with the *leaftet* library and RStudio. I took several coordinates of Amazon Pickup Locations around Orlando, Florida, USA and plotted them.
